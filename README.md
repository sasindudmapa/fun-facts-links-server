# Fun Facts

The MERN stack project consists of four subprojects, each serving different functionalities to create an interactive web application. The main goal of the project is to provide users with fun facts to read, allow them to upload and store personal URLs, and give the owner the ability to manage fun facts and uploaded URLs through a locally hosted React application.

This app consists of four parts. This is the part 1 of the Fun Facts Web App.

## Part 3: Backend and Database (User Uploaded URLs)

The third subproject involves another backend, also implemented using Node.js and Express, and a separate MongoDB database. This backend is responsible for handling the user-related functionality, specifically allowing users to upload and store their personal URLs. When a user uploads their URLs, they are securely stored in the database, associated with their account.
